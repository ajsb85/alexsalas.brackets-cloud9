Cloud9 button for Brackets
==========================

This extension adds a button to Brackets that lets you edit your projects directly in Cloud9 IDE.

From now on, you are only one click away from Cloud9 IDE when browsing projects on Brackets. Have you seen something mind-blowing? Click the button. Weâ€™ll clone the project, open it, and even load the file you were looking at. How is that for super-productivity?
